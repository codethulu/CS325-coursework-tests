this test tests how your program does with infinite loops and accidently also tests if your program handles the fact there is no returns in any block of a void function
if you see 1 printing forever, you probably PASSED, maybe consider Ctrl+C or Ctrl+Z to exit this test as it actually doesn't end automatically...
